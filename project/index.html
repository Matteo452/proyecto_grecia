      <td colspan="6"><p data-start="137" data-end="386">Greece is a country where everyday life is deeply connected to history, land, and shared rituals. Its gastronomy, culture, sports, places, and characters form a single story shaped by thousands of years of continuity rather than isolated traditions.</p>
        <p data-start="388" data-end="990">Greek food is rooted in simplicity and balance. Olive oil, vegetables, grains, cheese, and herbs form the base of a cuisine designed to be shared. Meals are social moments, often lasting for hours, where dishes such as moussaka, grilled meats, pies filled with cheese or greens, and slow-cooked legumes are placed at the center of the table. Sweets made with honey, nuts, and filo pastry reflect ancient flavors, while drinks like ouzo, wine, and strong Greek coffee accompany conversation rather than rush it. Eating in Greece is not just nourishment; it is an expression of hospitality and belonging.</p>
        <p data-start="992" data-end="1590">Greek culture is one of the foundations of the Western world, yet it remains very much alive and evolving. From ancient mythology and philosophy to theater and democratic ideals, Greece has long explored what it means to be human. Music and dance continue this exploration, blending joy, melancholy, and resilience in styles such as rebetiko and traditional circle dances. Religious celebrations, village festivals, and name days structure the rhythm of the year, reinforcing strong family and community ties. Hospitality, known as filoxenia, is not a concept but a practice embedded in daily life.</p>
      <p data-start="1592" data-end="2070">Sport holds a special place in Greek identity, linking the modern nation to its ancient past. The Olympic Games were born on Greek soil, celebrating physical excellence and fair competition. Today, sports such as football and basketball inspire intense loyalty and collective emotion, while the marathon stands as a symbolic bridge between ancient legend and modern endurance. Athletic achievement is seen not only as competition, but as character, discipline, and shared pride.</p>        <h3 data-start="198" data-end="231">&nbsp;</h3></td>

      <td colspan="6"><p data-start="2072" data-end="2637">The geography of Greece is as diverse as its history. Cities like Athens and Thessaloniki blend ancient ruins with contemporary life, while archaeological sites such as the Acropolis, Delphi, and Olympia stand as reminders of civilizations that shaped global thought. The Greek islands, scattered across the Aegean and Ionian seas, offer contrasting identities, from rugged mountains to whitewashed villages and deep blue waters. Natural landscapes such as Mount Olympus, Meteora, and dramatic gorges reinforce the strong connection between myth, nature, and place.</p>
        <p data-start="2639" data-end="3230">Greek identity is also carried through its characters, both mythical and real. The gods and heroes of mythology, like Zeus, Athena, Achilles, and Odysseus, continue to influence art, language, and storytelling worldwide. Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundations of critical thinking and ethics. Historical figures like Alexander the Great and Leonidas symbolize ambition, leadership, and sacrifice. In modern times, artists, musicians, filmmakers, and athletes have carried Greek culture onto the global stage, blending tradition with contemporary expression.</p>
      <p data-start="3232" data-end="3503">Together, these elements form a living culture rather than a preserved monument. Greece is not only a destination or a chapter in history, but a continuous dialogue between past and present, where food, ideas, movement, landscape, and people remain deeply interconnected.</p></td>

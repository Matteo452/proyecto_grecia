        <p data-start="0" data-end="505">The <strong data-start="4" data-end="18">pankration</strong> (also spelled <em data-start="33" data-end="44">pancracio</em>) was one of the most famous and brutal combat sports of <strong data-start="101" data-end="119">Ancient Greece</strong> and is widely regarded as the <strong data-start="150" data-end="209">historical precursor of modern mixed martial arts (MMA)</strong>. The word <em data-start="220" data-end="232">pankration</em> comes from the Greek <em data-start="254" data-end="259">pan</em> (&ldquo;all&rdquo;) and <em data-start="272" data-end="280">kratos</em> (&ldquo;power&rdquo; or &ldquo;force&rdquo;), meaning &ldquo;the use of all strength.&rdquo; It was officially introduced into the <strong data-start="376" data-end="412">ancient Olympic Games in 648 BCE</strong>, during the 33rd Olympiad, and quickly became one of the most prestigious and feared events.</p>
        <p data-start="507" data-end="1099">Pankration was a <strong data-start="524" data-end="562">full-contact, unarmed combat sport</strong> that combined techniques from <strong data-start="593" data-end="615">boxing (pygmachia)</strong> and <strong data-start="620" data-end="640">wrestling (pale)</strong>, while allowing a far broader range of actions. Fighters could strike with fists and feet, perform throws, takedowns, joint locks, chokes, and ground fighting. Combat could take place both standing and on the ground, with no separation between phases. Almost everything was permitted; the <strong data-start="930" data-end="993">only universally banned actions were biting and eye-gouging</strong>, although attacks to the genitals were often considered dishonorable or illegal depending on the context.</p>
        <p data-start="1101" data-end="1654">There were <strong data-start="1112" data-end="1164">no weight classes, no rounds, and no time limits</strong>. Matches continued until one fighter was rendered unconscious, physically unable to continue, or signaled surrender by raising a finger. Because of these conditions, pankration bouts could last a very long time and frequently resulted in <strong data-start="1403" data-end="1431">severe injuries or death</strong>. Despite this—or perhaps because of it—the sport was highly admired as the ultimate test of strength, endurance, skill, and mental toughness. Spartan warriors in particular valued pankration as preparation for real combat.</p>

      <td colspan="6"><p data-start="1656" data-end="2232">The sport also held strong <strong data-start="1683" data-end="1725">mythological and cultural significance</strong>. Greek legends attributed its creation to heroes such as <strong data-start="1783" data-end="1795">Heracles</strong> and <strong data-start="1800" data-end="1811">Theseus</strong>, who were said to have used pankration-like techniques in their mythical battles. Victorious pankratiasts were celebrated as heroes, earning fame, statues, and lifelong honors in their home cities. One of the most famous stories is that of <strong data-start="2052" data-end="2078">Arrhichion of Phigalia</strong>, an Olympic champion who died during a match while applying a submission; his opponent surrendered first, and Arrhichion was crowned victor posthumously.</p>
        <p data-start="2234" data-end="2740">Pankration existed in different forms, including competitions for both <strong data-start="2305" data-end="2326">adults and youths</strong>, and it remained a core Olympic event until the ancient Games were abolished in the late Roman period. Although it was not included in the <strong data-start="2466" data-end="2506">modern Olympic Games revived in 1896</strong>, its legacy survives today. Modern versions of pankration are practiced worldwide under regulated rules, and the ancient discipline is widely recognized as a foundational influence on <strong data-start="2691" data-end="2739">MMA, combat sports, and martial arts history</strong>.</p>
      <p data-start="2742" data-end="3033" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">In essence, pankration was the <strong data-start="2773" data-end="2836">most complete and extreme combat sport of the ancient world</strong>, designed to simulate real fighting with minimal restrictions, and it remains one of the clearest historical examples of humanity&rsquo;s long-standing fascination with full-contact, mixed-style combat.</p></td>
